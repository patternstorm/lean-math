## The Mathpunk Manifesto

Mathpunk is a philosophy of formal mathematics **enabled by** proof assistants and proof checkers.

These tools revolutionize mathematics by **physicalizing the mathematical universe**— allowing it to be explored by anyone as if it was a physical reality, thus **democratizing mathematics**.

**Mathpunk builds on this foundation with a single, foundational principle:**

We use these tools to **explore the mathematical universe** free of all baggage, and we categorically reject their use for proof automation.

- **We are hardcore about this:** Proofs must be explicit, contain all steps and be readable.
- **Why?** Because proofs reveal understanding. Automated proofs obscure it.

In Mathpunk, the machine just renders the mathematical universe, **we setup the foundations and we write the proofs**.

A Mathpunk project is defined by its method, not its subject. It adheres to the foundational principle, and has three core characteristics:

### 1. DIY Foundations
A Mathpunk project does not accept any of the existing foundations, builts its own, ans shows how mathematics unfolds from them with explicit, complete, readable proofs. Demonstrating how every concept—from sets to functions to numbers— derive from the foundations.

### 2. Power Over Safety
Modern proof assistants are designed to prevent paradox and guarantee termination. We appreaciate this feature, and the safety it brings, but Mathpunk prioritizes expressive power over safety, embracing "unsafe" features like unrestricted recursion. The responsibility for ensuring consistency and termination rests entirely within the user, not the tool, because the user writes down the proofs.

### 3. Radical Explicitness
There is no hidden magic. Every step of a proof must be manually and explicitly derived. Automated tactics are forbidden. Verbosity is accepted as the price of clarity. The goal is not just to prove that a theorem is true, but to show *why* it is true in the most granular way possible.

## About This Project

This repository is a **Mathpunk take on Neo-Logicism**.

It applies the Mathpunk philosophy to a specific foundational thesis: that mathematics can be derived directly from **Logic** itself, given the "right notion" of predicate, without needing to assume "Sets" or "Types" or any other primitive concepts. It uses Natural Deduction as the proof system.

This project uses the Lean 4 as the virtual reality engine that renders the Mathematical Universe.
